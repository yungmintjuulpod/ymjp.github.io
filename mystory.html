	<h1 class="center">My Story</h1>
	<p>I am a 17 year old former addict who is in recovery. I started off with psychedelics such as LSD in freshman year and was addicted to it for 6 months straight. I gained HPPD which made me start using alcohol and benzos. Alcoholism led me to do bad things like drink and drive and steal and my alcoholism journey ended in a DUI car crash. The car crash got me in to opioids as I was prescribed vicodin and I was able to manage it for a few months until the release of 7-OH which is a semi-synthetic kratom analogue. I was addicted to 7-OH for about 8 months straight and it led me to use  heroin. I was using heroin for about 4 months until I finally decided to get help. I checked myself in to a detox center and then a 60 day rehab center. I have been clean for about 80 days now. </p>
